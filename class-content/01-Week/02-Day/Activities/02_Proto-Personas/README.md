    - Go to [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com).
    - Try to create a proto persona for a person who uses Airbnb.

3. Fill out each section.

    - Who is your user?
    - What is their demographic info?
    - What does your user like?
    - What matters to them?
    - What is the user trying to accomplish?
