## 7.2 Lesson Plan: Project 1 Presentations

---

### Overview

Today students will present their group projects. 

---

### Class Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

- Practice presenting information to an audience.
- Provide constructive feedback to their peers.

---

### Instructor Notes

- Today's class is all about student presentations.
- Students will be nervous. It is important to set a supportive tone by instructing the class to clap before a group starts their presentation and after it ends.
- Arrive early to class so that you can configure the room appropriately for presentations, including Panopto, microphones, and any other necessary equipment.
- Students should present using your laptop so that we can use Panopto to record the presentation session. You should remind students to prepare their projects to be shared via a link in Slack. Periodically check to verify Panopto is still recording between different groups.
- When their presentation is complete, students will answer open-floor questions from you, TAs, and classmates. Providing clear feedback is critical for your students, so make sure you follow the advice in this plan.
- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [TimeTracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R39_1vUOUcX6x1GlK4W7dYiLd02lFOcU8wsfldYpjqw/edit?usp=sharing).
