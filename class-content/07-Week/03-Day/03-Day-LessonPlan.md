## 7.3 Lesson Plan: Project 1 Presentations

---

### Overview

Today students will present their group projects. 

---

### Class Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

- Practice presenting information to an audience.
- Provide constructive feedback to their peers.

---

### Instructor Notes

- Today's class is all about student presentations.
- Students will be nervous. It is important to set a supportive tone by instructing the class to clap before a group starts their presentation and after it ends.
- At the conclusion of their presentation, students will answer questions from you, TAs, and classmates. Providing feedback is critical for the students, so make sure you follow the advice in this plan.
- This class is about setting students up for success during the rest of the course. We want students to grasp the importance of storytelling in regards to sharing work. We want them to internalize the case study process.
- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [TimeTracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RKuodu4sANAiQDySS0zseGNSfQPappJBAwP254pZzsc/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Instructions 

- Go down the list and send each group to the front of the class. 
- Give students roughly two minutes to set up.
- When a group nears the 10-minute mark, motion for them to draw their presentation to a close (like pointing to your watch/imaginary watch).

- Follow each of these presentations with 5–10 minutes of questions about their projects. 
- Let TAs and classmates ask questions too.
- When the Q&A session concludes, point out what you found impressive and what they can improve on for future demonstrations.
